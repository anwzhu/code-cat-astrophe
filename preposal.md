## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A word game that takes a spin on the party game BombParty where the player must lure their rebellious cat back home through the temptation of various foods locked away in separate safes (implying the cat left due to the player's reluctance to overfeed them). To unlock the safes, the player must enter a valid English word that incorporates a sequence of letters depicted on the screen. Each safe has four solvable sequences and acts as one round out of the overall four where the last dish successfully entices the cat. The catch is that there is a time limit to solving each sequence, which reduces with every round, and if the player does not enter a valid word on time, the cat zaps the player using a space laser and ends with 'Game Over'. Also, this game takes place in space.
