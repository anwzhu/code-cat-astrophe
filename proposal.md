# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Code Cat-astrophe

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A word game where players are prompted a set of letters in which a valid English word must be entered before time runs out. This game surrounds a humorous storyline between an owner and his/her cat who rebels due to their insatiable, yet fishy, desires.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using the engine PyGame, this game first displays an immersive storyline with auditory effects and visual illustrations. Players will be able to customize the cat's name and appearance upon entering the game and watch a short visual novel displaying the backstory of the conflict between the owner and cat. Once the introduction concludes, the visual novel continues through the owner's POV in a spacecraft, searching for their cat who fled the galaxy. After encountering the cat in space, the game transitions to the fundamental task which is to unlock four safes sheltering the rarest species of fish by 'decoding' ten differing sets of letters per safe. The game will accept keyboard inputs, display a time limit that decreases with each safe, or round, and enhance the difficulty of the sets of letters depending on the round as well. For each valid English word inputted, the game cumulates score of the number of letters to add onto the 'Highscores' screen upon completion of the game. If players complete all four rounds, the screen will display a cutscreen of the owner and cat happily reuniting, followed by a post-credits scene. If players run out of time during a round, the game results in 'Game Over' where players can choose to 'Exit Game' or 'Restart'.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I complete the code for the word game itself. Players will be prompted a specific set of letters and be able to enter a word of their choice. The game will verify whether this input is a valid English word from a list. If the word is valid, the game will accept it and players cannot reuse that word for the rest of the game's duration. If the word is invalid, visual and auditory effects will play in response, but users can still input a valid English word as long as time lasts. The game will also show a time limit/countdown for each round.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I create a visual storyline depicting the backstory (introduction) of the cat's rebellion. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
