# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Code Cat-astrophe

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A word game where players are prompted a set of letters in which a valid English word must be entered before time runs out. This game surrounds a humorous storyline between an owner and his/her cat who rebels due to their insatiable, yet fishy, desires.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using the engine PyGame, this game first displays an immersive storyline with auditory effects and visual illustrations. Players will be able to customize the cat's name and appearance upon entering the game and watch a short visual novel displaying the backstory of the conflict between the owner and cat. Once the introduction concludes, the visual novel continues through the owner's POV in a spacecraft, searching for their cat who fled the galaxy. After encountering the cat in space, the game transitions to the fundamental task which is to unlock four safes sheltering the rarest species of fish by 'decoding' ten differing sets of letters per safe. The game will display a time limit that decreases with each safe, or round, and enhance the difficulty of the sets of letters depending on the round as well. If players complete all four rounds, the screen will display a cutscreen of the owner and cat happily reuniting, followed by a post-credits scene. If players run out of time during a round, the game results in 'Game Over' where players can choose to 'Exit Game' or 'Restart'.
